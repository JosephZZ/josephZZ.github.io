I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UCLA, co-advised by [Demetri Terzopoulos](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~dt/), [Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/), and [Yingnian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/). My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, morality, and consciousness.

Before starting my PhD, I was a co-founding partner at [VoxelCloud Inc.](https://www.voxelcloud.ai/) (2016--2021), an AI medical imaging company that raised nearly $100M in funding from Tencent, Sequoia China, and others. Our work was published in venues including *Nature Medicine* and *Nature Biomedical Engineering*.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from UCLA (2012--2017), with double minors in Cognitive Science and Philosophy.
