I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at UCLA, co-advised by [Demetri Terzopoulos](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~dt/), [Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/), and [Yingnian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/). My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, morality, and consciousness.

Before starting my PhD, I was a co-founding partner at [VoxelCloud Inc.](https://www.voxelcloud.ai/) (2016--2021), an AI medical imaging company that raised nearly $100M in funding from Tencent, Sequoia China, and others. Our work was published in venues including *Nature Medicine* and *Nature Biomedical Engineering*.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from UCLA (2012--2017), with double minors in Cognitive Science and Philosophy.

My PhD research centers on understanding the nature of three fundamental aspects of mind -- **intelligence**, **morality**, and **consciousness** -- through formal theory and computational formulation, and on developing AI algorithms and frameworks grounded in these insights (see my [academic works](/academic-work/)). Aside from this framework of designing research questions, my interests can also be described by the broad goal of **self-evolving AI** (how to be like a scientist that discovers and learns, or like a philosopher that introspects and improves) and **human-centered AI** (what is good for humans, and how to make it good for humans).

I am actively looking for collaborators at all levels (undergraduate, master, and junior PhD). What I value most is **agency** and **persistency** -- all major backgrounds are welcome. Feel free to reach out for a chat about potential projects and collaborations.

I am currently on the job market. If you have AI positions or internship opportunities, I would love to hear from you -- please feel free to reach out.
